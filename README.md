## Description: 

This project is a command-line application that creates a good README file by answering a few prompts. It utilizes (fs) for writing the file, (util) to promisify the writing of the file and (inquirer) to ask the questions. In fact, the README for this project was created with this application. The README that is created is stored in the 'generated' file to keep it separate from this README.
